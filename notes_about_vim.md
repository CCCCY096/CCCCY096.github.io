# Notes about Vim

## How to learn Vim ~~according to me~~

**Step 1**: Run `vimtutor` and step through the tutorial. Take less than half an hour during the first try. Repeat a few times if you will.

**Step 2**: Practice the basic motions and commands taught in the tutorial. **VS Code + Vim key-binding** plugin is a good playground because you can always work around by using the normie editing when you forget Vim syntax.

**Step 3**: Learn more advanced usages, like registers, options ( `hlsearch, ic, ...` ), more complex motions and commands and so on.

**Step 4**: Maybe it's time to use `vim` or `Neovim` with plugins as a productivity tool. I'm still stuck in this stage so I don't know what to tell you. I heard it's damn messy to use those plugins.

**Step 5**: Profits.

**A little tip**: Use Vim-like plugins like `vimium` in your browser! Use `h, j, k, l` to navigate, use `o, O` to open a new tab... You name it! They really boost up your efficiency in browsing. And you get to practice some Vim motion and commands!
