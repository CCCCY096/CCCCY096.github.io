## World's Finest List of Apps & Tools

### Typora - Markdown Editor

***Minimalistic + real-time rendering + extensive supports***. I'm using Typora writing down this line ðŸ˜‰

### VS Code

Well this one is way too famous for me to introduce.

What I like about it though: ***remote WSL/SSH + multiple language support + active community***



### PowerToys Run - Launcher & File Searcher

Microsoft *PowerToys* is a set of utilities for power users. One of them, the ***PowerToys Run***, is a quick launcher by searching. It's still in preview version, so it has to be downloaded from its [official github page](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).

There are other excellent launchers with searching abilities too, like [Listary](https://www.listary.com/). I prefer PowerToys Run for its consistent UI and not-bad efficiency.
