### Typora - Markdown Editor

***Minimalistic + real-time rendering + extensive supports***. I'm using Typora writing down this line ðŸ˜‰

### Visual Studio Code

Well this one is way too famous for me to introduce.

What I like about it though: ***remote WSL/SSH + multiple language support + active community***

Update: ***vim*** key binding!

### PowerToys Run - Launcher & File Searcher

Microsoft *PowerToys* is a set of utilities for power users. One of them, the ***PowerToys Run***, is a quick launcher by searching. It's still in preview version, so it has to be downloaded from its [official github page](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).

There are other excellent launchers with searching abilities too, like [Listary](https://www.listary.com/). I prefer PowerToys Run for its consistent UI and not-bad efficiency. 

### Oh-my-zsh

Awesome *z shell* framework. Easy plugin and theme management. [Check it out!](https://ohmyz.sh/)

I think the biggest downside is that personal configurations (like `$PATH` variable) need to be set in ***zsh-specific profiles*** like `.zshrc`, `zprofile` and so on. The reason behind this is that *zsh* is not perfectly compatible with *sh*, which means *zsh* won't source profiles like `/etc/profile` .

But besides the inconvenience mentioned above, *oh-my-zsh* will make your life so much easier.
